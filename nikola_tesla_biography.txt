Nikola Tesla Biography

Nikola Tesla (1856â€“1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia), Tesla displayed remarkable intellect and imagination from a young age. He studied engineering in Austria and later moved to the United States in 1884, where he worked with Thomas Edison briefly before the two parted ways due to differing views on electrical power systems.

Tesla's major contributions include the development of AC motors, transformers, the Tesla coil, and early work in radio transmission. He also experimented with wireless power transmission and envisioned technologies far ahead of his time, such as wireless communication and energy.

Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled financially and was often overshadowed by more commercially successful contemporaries. He died in relative obscurity on January 7, 1943, in New York City, but his legacy continues to influence science and engineering profoundly.
