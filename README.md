# Semantic Document Search Engine

A desktop application that allows users to search through documents semantically using OpenAI's vector store and GPT models. Upload PDF, TXT, or CSV files and ask questions about their content.

## Features

- Clean, modern UI built with tkinter
- Document upload functionality supporting PDF, TXT, and CSV files
- Semantic search using OpenAI's vector stores
- Context-aware responses based on document content
- Simple chat-like interface for queries and responses

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation


1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/nebulaw/semantic-search-engine.git

   cd semantic-document-search
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Upload a document using the file button (üìÅ) in the bottom left
3. Type your query in the text field
4. Press Enter or click the send button (‚û§) to submit your query
5. View the response in the chat window

## Project Structure


- `app/` - Main application directory
  - `chat.py` - UI implementation with tkinter
  - `client.py` - OpenAI client and vector store operations
  - `helpers.py` - Utility functions for the application
- `.env` - Environment variables (API keys)
- `main.py` - Entry point for the application
- `requirements.txt` - requirements
- `symp.txt` - A sample document for testing

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Files are uploaded to OpenAI's vector store for semantic indexing
2. **Query Processing**: User questions are matched against the document content using vector search
3. **Response Generation**: The application uses the search results as context for generating relevant answers
4. **UI Display**: Responses are displayed in a chat-like interface

## Dependencies

The application relies on:
- OpenAI's API for vector storage and retrieval
- tkinter for the user interface
- Python's standard library for file operations
